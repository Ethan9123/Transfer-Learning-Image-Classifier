# Transfer-Learning-Image-Classifier

simpleimage.html is a web page with a picture of a dog and in the Javascript console in Developer Tools, the top three predictions of MobileNet!

campred.html is a web page using webcamera. In this page, it will predict the top class showing on the web camera in the Javascript console.

Index.html is a web page with three buttoms. You can train the machine learning model by clicking the buttoms. You can use common objects or face/body gestures to capture images for each of the three classes. Each time you click one of the "Add" buttons, one image is added to that class as a training example. While you do this, the model continues to make predictions on webcam images coming in and shows the results in real-time.
